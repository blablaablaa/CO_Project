# CO_Project  

This is a first-year project for the **Computer Organization** class.  

## Project Overview  
Our first task is to develop an **assembler** that can perform the following functions:  
- Read a given **assembly language** input.  
- Convert each instruction into its corresponding **binary representation**.  
- Generate the resulting **machine code**.  

Further tasks include:  
- Creating a **simulator** that tracks the values stored in each register after executing each instruction.  

The **ISA** (Instruction Set Architecture) we are working with is **RV32I (RISC-V)**.
